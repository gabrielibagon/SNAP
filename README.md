SNAP (Revision)
====

This is my ongoing exploration on revising the SNAP platform, focusing on integration with the Unity 3D platform for the development of scientific experiments and gaming projects.

My goal is to substitute some of the tools used in the original SNAP platform with the following:

1. Python 2.7+ or Python 3+ for the execution environment
2. Unity3D for development of virtual reality environments
3. PsychoPy for other types of experimental stimulus
4. LabStreamingLayer for networking
